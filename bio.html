        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am 20 years old and I enter the college at 18. Before I started, I never had any programming experience. However, after starting, I fell in love and here I am, programming several hours a day. Currently, my favorite programming language is Java and I am looking to learn about other technologies, such as React Native.
